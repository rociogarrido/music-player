# Music Player 🎧

## How I worked on this project 👩🏼‍💻

🚀 The main goal of this project is to build an user-friendly, nice-looking and simple music player.

## How to navigate this project 🧭

- Pure CSS and Vanilla JS.
- The application fetches data from the data.js file.
- Modern looking designs, cool animations like play/pause animation, disk rotating animation and pulse animation.
- Working forward/backward buttons with seek-able song slider.

## Why I built the project this way 🚧

- I wanted to improve using keyframes and animations.

## If I had more time I would change this ⌛

- I would fetch data from any free music data API, such as iTunes API, LastFM API or Spotify API.
